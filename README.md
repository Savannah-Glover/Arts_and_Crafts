## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to give me some practice using html and css styling to create a webpage from minimal instruction. The only resources I was given to complete this are the four images included in the resources/images folder, and the Website_Specifications document which shows what the page should look like and provides extra information about the styling I should use.

My goal in this project was to make my webpage look as accurate to the specifications as possible. Additionally, I wanted to practice only incorporating CSS styling inside of my index.css file while leaving my html relatively blank.
